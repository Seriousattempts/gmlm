3DR CODE

Make a SVG MATRIX with Game Maker code
- SVG can include JavaScript, potentially leading to cross-site scripting
- a Reed–Solomon code can detect (but not correct) any combination of up to t erroneous symbols, or locate and correct up to ⌊t/2⌋ erroneous symbols at unknown locations. As an erasure code, it can correct up to t erasures at locations that are known and provided to the algorithm, or it can detect and correct combinations of errors and erasures.

The goal is to eliminate 2D elements appearing in a 3D space.
- Have various applications (Data strages) appear with vector graphics

- Randomize their physics to determine their collisions and object interactions.
- Specify parameter ranges to classify 2D and 3D labeling
