# Test 

What can you do with a 3DR CODE? Wait, what is that?

Make a SVG MATRIX with GML
- SVG can include JavaScript, so cross-site scripting.

Reed-Solomon https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction
- a Reed–Solomon code can detect (but not correct) any combination of up to t erroneous symbols, or locate and correct up to ⌊t/2⌋ erroneous symbols at unknown locations. As an erasure code, it can correct up to t erasures at locations that are known and provided to the algorithm, or it can detect and correct combinations of errors and erasures.

Imagine a game where the goal is to eliminate 2D elements appearing in a 3D space.
- Have various applications (Data strages) appear with vector graphics
