MCP architecture:
1. MCP Host: The AI application that coordinates and manages one or multiple MCP clients
2. MCP Client: A component that maintains a connection to an MCP server and obtains context from an MCP server for the MCP host to use
3. MCP Server: A program that provides context to MCP clients

Expose functionality from HTTPS or other API controls to allow bot to make actions based upon our request. The goal is to make a workflow connecting multiple applications for GameMaker. Cursor example needs work, but this is the best workflow that I'll do in the future below

GMEdit | https://yellowafterlife.itch.io/gmedit?ac=MaWLFKw7mhHDp

Create a mcp plugin creation. But what can it uses that GMEdit has available?
- Create a plugin that runs an internal HTTP server, similar to Ghidramcp bridge.
- Add HTTP endpoints to existing build plugins?
- Run local LLM through Ollama (https://ollama.com/) or LMStudio (https://lmstudio.ai/) through a local server, add chat features to GMEdit

ART
Aesprite has an api that you can integrate into an API mcp server with Lua https://www.aseprite.org/api/
- Use it to generate images with diffusion models or create images based on available tools

You can use mcp to generate images for your game.

I recommend using RetroDiffusion (if you're interested in 2D)

You can get updated diffusion models locally

GIMP

Should be possible because it's uses Python:
