https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol

1. MCP Host: The AI application that coordinates and manages one or multiple MCP clients
2. MCP Client: A component that maintains a connection to an MCP server and obtains context from an MCP server for the MCP host to use
3. MCP Server: A program that provides context to MCP clients

## ART DIRECTION EDITION = GENERATION SERVER
Aesprite has an api that you can integrate into an API mcp server with Lua https://www.aseprite.org/api/
- Use it to generate images with diffusion models or create images based on available tools
-NEverArt - AI image generation using various models https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers-archived/tree/main/src/everart

## I recommend using RetroDiffusion
### Reason https://discord.com/channels/946975092376731688/1078348290170560603/1302735173770805308

You can get updated diffusion models to run locally

- https://astropulse.itch.io/retrodiffusion?ac=MaWLFKw7mhHDp

- Or use their RetroDiffusion's API https://www.retrodiffusion.ai/
- Or use Sketchfab's API https://sketchfab.com/developers
